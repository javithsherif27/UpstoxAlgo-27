# LocalStack Development Scripts (Updated - Fixed Path Issues)

## Interactive Launcher (RECOMMENDED)
.\dev-launcher.bat

## Full Stack Options
.\start-local.bat           # LocalStack + Backend + Frontend
.\start-local-dev.bat       # Alternative full stack  
.\start-all.bat             # Traditional + LocalStack

## Individual Services  
.\start-localstack.bat      # LocalStack only
.\start-backend.bat         # Backend only (auto-detects LocalStack)
.\start-frontend.bat        # Frontend only

## Stop Services
.\stop-local.bat            # Stop everything
.\stop-localstack.bat       # Stop LocalStack only

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Use .\ prefix in PowerShell: .\dev-launcher.bat
- Docker Desktop must be running for LocalStack
- Fixed: Path resolution in dev-launcher.bat
- Fixed: Removed obsolete version from docker-compose.localstack.yml
- python-dotenv installed successfully
